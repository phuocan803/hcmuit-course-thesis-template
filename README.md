## About The Project

This is a free, non-profit LaTeX template built specifically for students of the **Faculty of Computer Networks and Communications** when completing their end-of-semester course projects.

Writing a report that is correct, consistent, and well-formatted is a challenge — especially when working in a group with multiple people editing at the same time. Common problems when using Google Docs or Microsoft Word:

- **Math equations:** Difficult to type, prone to formatting errors when copying between sections.
- **Inconsistent formatting:** Font size, headings, captions, and numbered lists vary from chapter to chapter.
- **References:** Manual management is time-consuming and error-prone.

This template solves all of those problems. You only need to focus on the **content** — formatting is already taken care of.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Component

Software

TeX distribution

[TeX Live 2022+](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)

Compiler

pdfLaTeX or XeLaTeX

Bibliography backend

Biber

### Recommended Editors

- **VS Code** + [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension
- **TeXstudio**
- **Overleaf** (online, no installation required)

### Compiling

Using `latexmk` (recommended):

```bash
latexmk -pdf -bibtex main
```

Or manually (Biber must be run **twice** due to per-chapter bibliographies):

```bash
pdflatex mainbiber    mainpdflatex mainbiber    mainpdflatex main
```

Clean auxiliary files:

```bash
latexmk -c
```

## Workflow

Step

Task

File

1

Edit group / supervisor info

`misc/cover.tex`

2

Write chapter content

`chapters/chapterN.tex`

3

Add references for each chapter

`references/chapterN/refs.bib`

4

Place figures for each chapter

`img/chapterN/`

5

Fill in the list of abbreviations

`misc/abbrev.tex`

6

Write abstract and acknowledgements

`misc/abstract.tex`, `misc/ack.tex`

> Search for the keyword **`TODO`** in any `.tex` file to find placeholders that need to be filled in.

---

## Important Notes

- Citations use **BibLaTeX + Biber** (not classic BibTeX).
- Each chapter has its **own bibliography section** at the end, with citation numbers increasing continuously across the whole document (`[1]`, `[2]`, ...). This requires Biber to be run **twice** — see the compile instructions above.
- Logo files must be placed in `img/logo/` matching the exact filenames referenced in `misc/cover.tex` (`logouit20-02.png` and `logoKhoa_Basic_latex.png`).
